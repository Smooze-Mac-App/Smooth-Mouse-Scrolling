Smooze is an innovative utility that breathes new life into your standard mouse, delivering Smooth Mouse Scrolling and powerful button reconfiguration. It addresses the limitations of default macOS mouse handling by introducing physics-based inertial scrolling that mimics the smoothness of a trackpad, making every interaction fluid and enjoyable. This utility is engineered for users who demand precision and efficiency from their hardware.

Beyond its exceptional scrolling enhancement, Smooze acts as a central hub for mouse customization. It allows you to remap the middle mouse button to execute a vast array of actions, from simple copy/paste commands to complex multi-step shortcuts like triggering Mission Control or opening specific applications. This functionality effectively transforms your mouse into a more versatile and productive tool, adaptable to any task or software environment. Its minimalistic interface ensures setup is straightforward, while advanced options provide depth for power users. Smooze operates with exceptional stability and low resource usage, ensuring a reliable experience that enhances your daily computing without getting in the way. It is the essential tool for anyone looking to upgrade their mouse control on a Mac.
